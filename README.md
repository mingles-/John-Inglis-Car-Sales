Site made for my father's car sales business. 

My first web project created with intention of deploying on Heroku. Uses the Stormpath API to store the administrator account and to send and receive car information as JSON.   The application features a login system which allows administrator to add/delete/edit/upload photos to cars. A list of cars can be seen on the stocklist. Each respective car has it's own page, displaying further information not shown in the stocklist. Each car may also have up to 5 photos uploaded which can be viewed enlarged using an external Javascript library.
